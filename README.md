## **Domain of Interest**
- ##### _Why are you interested in this field/domain?_
    Social justice and injustice is a very common topic in US, but what we learned about this were all about what we should do, but not about what we are doing. So I hope from this project we will have better understanding of the social justice and injustice.

- ##### _What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain?_

- ##### _What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain?_
    1. How widespread is racial prejudice? Not all the racial bias is targeted towards black people. As I searched there are four races in the world. So what about the prejudice to each of them?
    2. People from which race have the highest unemployment rate? And why is that?
    a specific comparison between the chance of each race that might meet a racial injustice.
    3. Which race of juveniles are treated the roughest by the criminal system? For a similar statute, what percentage of crimes by race were charged as a felony or misdemeanor?
    4. How many people are killed by police in the United States every year, and what racial bias or prejudice is there, if any? Do police actually respond differently to different races at the scenes they are called to?

DataMade obtained several years of individual-level juvenile arrest data by submitting a FOIA request to the Chicago Police Department. They also created demographic profiles for each police district using census_area, their open-source Python library for querying Census data using arbitrary geographic boundaries.
